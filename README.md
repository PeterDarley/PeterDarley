# Peter Darley
I'm currently working at the [Mullins Retrovirology Lab](https://mullinslab.microbiol.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington Department of Microbiology](https://microbiology.washington.edu/uw-microbiology-home) where I develop tools for the collection, distribution, and analysis of scientific data.  The projects I've worked on here are:

## Full Systems
Some of these are available at the [Mullins Lab GitHub page](https://github.com/MullinsLab)

### Phylobook
[Phylobook GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MullinsLab/phylobook)

The Phylobook paper is pending publication in the journal [BioTechniques](https://www.biotechniques.com/)

### Viroverse
Viroverse GitHub Repo is private until completion

### HiRIS - HIV-1 Reservoirs Integration Sites “high-rise”

## Reusable Open Source Components

### Highlighter
[Highlighter GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MullinsLab/Highlighter)

Hilighter is a pure Python extension to [Biopython](https://github.com/biopython/biopython) to detect point mutations in the members of a sequence alignment, and to plot either matching or mismatched nucleotides or amino acids.  It's written with a focus on adjustable formatting.

This is a rewrite of the excelent web based [LANL Highlighter ](https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIGHLIGHT/highlighter_top.html) tool.

It is currently needing more documentation before it gets submitted to Biopython, so is monkey patching at the moment.  My hope is that it will be part of the standard Biopython at some point.
